The objective of this project is to develop a dashboard for Customer Personality Analysis. 
This analysis involves thoroughly examining the characteristics of a company's target customers. 
It assists businesses in gaining a deeper understanding of their customers and enables them to adapt their products more effectively to cater to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different customer segments.

1. Replacing any missing values in the "Income" column with the average income value from the column.
2. Deriving the "Age" column based on the information provided in the "Year Birth" column.
3. Creating an "Age bin" column by categorizing customers into different age groups.
